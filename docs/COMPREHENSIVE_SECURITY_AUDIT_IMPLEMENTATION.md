    target_username="user@example.com",
    attempt_count=5,
    time_window="5 minutes",
    source_ip="192.168.1.100"
)

# Access denied events
AuditService.log_access_denied(
    resource_type="admin_panel",
    resource_id="/admin/users",
    reason="Insufficient privileges"
)

# Privilege escalation attempts
AuditService.log_privilege_escalation(
    from_role="user",
    to_role="admin",
    escalation_method="direct_access",
    success=False
)
```

### 2. Security Violations
```python
# Security policy violations
AuditService.log_security_violation(
    violation_type="MALICIOUS_FILE_UPLOAD",
    description="Attempt to upload PHP script",
    severity="HIGH",
    details={"filename": "malicious.php", "blocked": True}
)

# Suspicious activity detection
AuditService.log_suspicious_activity(
    activity_type="OFF_HOURS_ACCESS",
    description="User access outside normal hours",
    risk_score=30,
    details={"access_time": "02:30 AM", "user_id": 123}
)
```

### 3. Data Protection & Compliance
```python
# Data breach attempt detection
AuditService.log_data_breach_attempt(
    attack_type="SQL_INJECTION",
    target_data="user_database",
    detection_method="request_analysis",
    blocked=True
)

# Compliance event logging
AuditService.log_compliance_event(
    compliance_type="DATA_ACCESS",
    event_description="Bulk data export performed",
    regulation="GDPR",
    compliant=True
)
```

### 4. System Security
```python
# System security events
AuditService.log_system_security(
    event_type="SECURITY_UPDATE",
    description="Security monitoring system updated",
    severity="INFO",
    system_component="security_monitor"
)

# File access monitoring
AuditService.log_file_access(
    file_path="/sensitive/data.csv",
    access_type="READ",

curl -X POST -F "file=@malicious.php" http://localhost:5000/upload

# Simulate brute force attack
for i in {1..10}; do
    curl -X POST -d "username=admin&password=wrong" http://localhost:5000/login
done
```

### Monitoring Security Events
```python
# View recent security events
from app.models import AuditLog, AuditActionType

security_events = AuditLog.query.filter(
    AuditLog.action.in_([
        AuditActionType.SECURITY_VIOLATION,
        AuditActionType.SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY,
        AuditActionType.BRUTE_FORCE_ATTEMPT
    ])
).order_by(AuditLog.timestamp.desc()).limit(50).all()
```
